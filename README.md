# indian-sign-language-classification
This repository includes the code for the two approaches for identification and classification of Sign Language. 
1. Object detection-based approach utilizes a model built on scaled YOLOv4 architecture which performs a frame-by-frame inference.

2. Pose-based approach utilizes an LSTM model which takes the skeletal pose landmarks from Mediapipe for a sequence of frames as an input to infer and predict the action.
